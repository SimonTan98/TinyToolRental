# TinyToolRental
This application is an inventory management application for a tool rental store. The application tracks information about tools, customers, and orders. Creating this application
helped me learn how to use/connect different front and back-end tools to create a comprehensive app.

The backend was created twice. The first version of the backend was created using MS SQL Server. The second version was created using OracleDB and included new tables/fields to view historical data.

## Installation Instructions
Installation and usage instructions can be found under the "SQLServerToolRental" and "OracleToolRental" folders.
